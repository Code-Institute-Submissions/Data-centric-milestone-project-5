My website is a simple and easy to use recipe storage page where the user can view existing recipes and more importantly create new recipe, edit existing recipes and delete old or unneeded recipes. It holds a very simple design consisting of the site name located at the top and the list of recipes that have been added. The creation and edit pages are also following the simple theme as they contain a spread out and easy to understand form where the user can do whatever they need to do whenever they need it . The page contains no images or animations as I intend for the page to be one where you need to just pop on and have a quick reminder of ingredients or just to follow the baking method with no distractions or clutter filling the screen. 


## UX

When designing my website i had decided to create to target (but not limit it to) an elderly audience. With this in mind I tried to create a design that was very simple and unintimidating to use with minimal amounts of clutter and anything that may be potentially confusing or not vital to the websites functionality. The idea was to have as little buttons and accessories as possible to enable easy access to the users recipes they may have stored at any time or place. I also included various retail store shopping links in the footer of every page. The idea of this is to enable the user to click on these links and be redirected to an external shopping site where they can compare prices and get baking ingredients. 

The objective of this website is to enable the user to quickly and easily find,create,edit and delete any recipe they may have added to wanted to add. I have also made the design responsive so the user will have the ability to view thier recipe book on their mobile, tablet or pc at any time. This creates a new level of accessibility as this means no matter what situation/environment youre in you can always access the storge and tweak what you want.

I believe that my project is the ideal way to help the user achieve their goal of the website because i have implemented all of the core aspects of data manipulation in a very simple manner via the use of clear labeled buttons throughout the page to try and make the actions of each button as clear as possible. The user can create a new data entry with the click of a button and by filling in a nice and tidy form clearly laying out what input field does what. The user can also edit any stored data by clicking on the 'Edit recipe' button at any time and once again very easily find and alter their desired piece of data. And finally the user can also simply remove any data collection with the click of a button labeled 'delete' with a handy bin icon to further clarify the buttons outcome. 

## User Stories

As an elderly lady, I want to be able to go on my phone and double check the cooking method of my homemade trifle as I sometimes get forgetful. So i would need to open up the website and have a quick scroll through the list of recipes i have created so i can retrieve my recipe and make my trifle without fear of getting it wrong.

As a person in my 20's, I want to update one of my cheesecake recipes as i have found a newer and better version of it online which sounds much nicer. To do this i would need to hop on to the website and find the cheesecake recipe witha simple scroll down the page and once I have found it I will need to click the edit button and change any data that needs updating leaving the correct recipe on the home page ready for when i need it.

As a busy worker, I have very little time to make loads of different and time consuming recipes so i need to delete any recipes i won't have the time to make after work which will make finding the recipes i actually want to make a lot easier. For this all I would need to do is find the desired recipe and press the delete button.


## Features

### Existing features

My project hosts a rather simple and accessible style therefor there are not a whole load of dynamic features to overload the target user with. 

My first feature on my page is the logo. When clicked, this allows the user to navigate back to the home page where a list of the recipes can be found. 

My second feature is the 'Add recipes' button. This allows the users to create new data entries by having the user fill out the required form.

My third feature is the 'Edit recipes' button. This allows the users to alter existing data entries by having the user fill out the required form.

My fourth feature is the 'Delete' button. When clicked, this allows the user to completely remove existing data entries.

My fifth feature is the accordion format of the ingredients and method sections. This allows the user to have a clear overview of all the recipies on the home page however when the dropdown is triggered it will expand and display the desired information.

My sixth feature is the footer containign shopping site links, This allows the user to check various poplar retail store stocks to see where they can get the cheapest ingredients if they need some. 

### Future feature implementations

The first feature i want to add is the use of an account system. Having this in my website will drastically improve its usability as at this present time anyone can access the page and change a recipe at will. With the use of the account system, the experience will be a lot more personalised and better suited to the websites intention. The reason i did not include this feature is purely downt o lack of knowledge. I had a go at trying to implement it but after a couple of days i was running out of time to complete the website.

The second feature i would like to add is a chat section where any user can join with an account and start chatting and interacting with other people on the page. This would also improve the websites user experience as it will enable people to talk and share recipes and cooking tips. 

Thirdly, I would also be intersted in adding some sort of validation system where it will prevent users from creating meaningless spam entries clogging up the databases used to store the data. 

## Technologies Used



Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
